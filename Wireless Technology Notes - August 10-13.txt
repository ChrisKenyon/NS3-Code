Wireless Technology Notes - August 10-13


MIMO Capacity


- SISO:
	
	- C = B*log_2(1 + SINR)


- SIMO & MISO
	
	- C = B*log_2(1 + N * SINR)

	- N antennas at Rx (SIMO) or Tx (MISO)


- MIMO:
	
	- C = N * B * log_2(1 + SINR)

	- N Antennas at both Tx and Rx



OFDM

- Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
	- A multi-carrier modulation technique based on frequency division multiplexing
	- The entire channel bandwidth is divided into several narrow bandwidth channels
	- Contrary to traditional FDM, it packs multiple carriers into much smaller bandwidth (orthogonal sub-carriers) abd eliminates the needs for frequency guard bands
	- The modulated signals share the same center frequency


	Source Rate R
	N subcarriers - each centered at f_c + i/2 f_b
		-  i = -(N -1), -(N - 3), ..., -1, 1, ..., (N - 1)

- Advantages

	- If the data stream is protected by a forward error-correcting code frequency selective fading is easily handled
	- Overcomes inter-symbol interference (ISI) in a multipath environment
	- QPSK is a common modulation scheme used with OFDM
	- Signal processing involves two functions:
		- Fourier Transforms
			- Converting time-domain signals to frequency domain and vice versa
			- There is a discrete-time version of FT for digital signals, called DFT and IDFT
				- Implementation of DFT could be slow
				- Works best when the number of input samples is a power of 2 --- 8, 16, 64, 128, ...
			- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
				- Algorithm that converts a set of uniformly spaced data points from the time domain to the frequency domain
			- Inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT)
				- Reverses the FFT operation
				- Has the effect of ensuring that the subcarriers do not interfere with each other

		R -> T = 1/R
		DFT -> Fourier T for Digial

		FFT -> 2^m

	- Inter Block Interference & CP

		- ISI could destroy the orthogonality of the sub-carriers, the main premise behind OFDM
		- To combat this, each OFDM symbol is preceded with a cyclic prefix (CP)
			- CP is the last portion of each OFDM symbol copied to the beginning
			- Has nice properties that helps with easy channel estimation and equalization


OFDMA

	- A multiple access scheme using OFDM modulation
	- Several subcarriers are considered a sub-channel and assigned to a single user
	- Each receiving user demodulates the OFDM symbol and decodes its own subcarriers


PAPR

	- Peak-to-Average Power Ratio

	- In OFDMA, power of symbols varies significantly 
		- High PAPR
		- This is especially the case when more complicated modulation schemes such as QAM is used
		- Depends on the input bits and their modulated symbols
	- High PAPR drains the battery
	- Causes distortions if proper amplifiers are not used in the RF circuitry
	- Not good for battery operated users


SC-FDMA

	- Single-carrier FDMA
	- Similar to OFDMA, Bandwidth is divided into multiple subcarriers, but without PAPR problem


Spread Spectrum

	- Form of encoding for wireless communications
	- Can be used to transmit either analog or digital data, using an analog signal
	- Was initally developed for military and intelligence requirements
	- Essential idea is to spread the information signal over a wider bandwidth 
	  to make jamming and interception more difficult
		- Frequency hopping
		- Direct sequence

	- Effect of Spreading
		- Spreading code (pseudorandom sequence) is generated using an initial seed value for each transmitter
		- Much wider bandwidth is consumed than the original data bandwidth
		- Multiple users can use the same large bandwidth at the same time
			- Hence different from hDMA? ... ?



S_j(t) = sqrt(2 S_j) cos (2pi * f_c t)
	
	-  P = S_j

S_r(t) = S(t) + S_j(t) + n(t)


s_r(t) * c(t)
		  ^spreading code

S_j(t)c(t) = sqrt(2 * S_j)c(t)cos(2pi f_c t)   -> BPSK


2/T <<  2/T_c
