Analog and Digital Data Transmission

Data
 - Entities that convey information

Signals
 - Electric or electromagnetic representations of data

Signaling
 - Physical propagation of the signal along a suitable medium

Transmission
 - Communication of data by the propagation and processing of signals



Digital signals   			Vs 		   Analog Signals
Generally cheaper					   Suffer more from attenuation
Less susceptible to noise
  interference



Transmission Impairments

 - Signal received may differ from signal transmitted, causing:
   	- Analog: degradation of signal quality
   	- Digital: bit errors

 - Most significant impairments are 
 	- Attenuation and attenuation distortion
 	- Delay distortion
 	- Noise 

  Attenuation
 	- Decay of the amplitude of the signal
 	- To counter attenuation, the original signal can be sent with more power, or amplifiers could be placed in between trasmitter and receiver

  Noise
	- Thermal noise
		- Due to thermal agitation of electrons
	  	- Uniformly distributed accross bandwidths
	  	- Referred to as white noise
	- Intermodulation noise
	  	- Produced by nonlinearities in the transmitter, receiver, and/or intervening transmission medium
	  	- Effect is to produce signals at a frequency that is the sum of difference of the two original frequencies
	- Crosstalk
	  	- A signal from one line is picked up by another
	  	- Can occur by electrical coupling between nearby twisted pairs or when microwave antennas pick up unwanted signals
	- Impulse Noise
		- Caused by external electromagnectic interferences
		- Noncontinuous, consisting of irregular pulses or spikes
		- Short duration and high amplitude
		- Minor annoyance for analog signals, but a major source of error in digital data


Nyquist bandwidth

In the case of a channel that is noise free:
	- The limitation of data rate is simply the bandwidth of the signal
		- If the rate of signal transmission is 2B then a signal with frequencies no greater than B is sufficient to carry the signal rate
		- Given a bandwidth of B, the highest signal rate that can be carried is 2B
	- For binary signals, the data rate tha can be supported by B Hz is 2B bps
	- With multilevel signaling, the Nyquist formula becomes:    C = 2B log_2(M)
	- Data rate can be increased by increasing the number different signal elements
		- This increases burden on the receiver
		- Noise and other impairments limit the practical value of M

Shannon Capacity Formula

	- The basis for much of modern networking

	- Considering the relation of data rate, noise, and error rate:
		- Faster data rate shortens each bit so that bursts of noise corrupts more bits
		- Given noise level, higher rates means higher errors
	- Shannon developed formula relating these to signal to noise ratio (in decibels)
	- SNR_db = 10 log_10(signal / noise)
	- Capacity  C = B log_2(1 + SNR)

	- N_0 = k * T  watt/Hz     (average white noise at a Temperature in Kelvin)
	- k = 1.38 * 10^-23 J/K
	- N_watt = B * k * T
	- In dB scale:  log_10(N) = log_10(B) + log_10(k) + log_10(T)
												^
										   (-228.6dBW)

	- SNR = Signal power/noise power


	Example:
	B = 10 MHz
	SNR_db = 10 dB
	-----------------------------
	SNR_db = 10log_10(SNR_linear)
	C = 10*10^6 log_2(1 + 10)
	  = 35 Mbps


Spectral Efficiency = C / B = log_2(1 + SNR)
	- Spectral Efficiency is equal to SNR = 1, there is a linear relation at SNR < 1, and logarithmic at SNR > 1

Variables:
	- SNR: Signal to noise ratio 
	- B: Bandwidth
	- C: Capacity
	- E_b: Signal Energy
	- N_0: Noise Power
	- S: Signal Power
	- R: data rate
	
Relationships
	- E_b / N_0 ~ SNR
	- T_b = 1 / R
	- E_b = S*T_b
	- E_b / N_0 = (S*T_b)/(kT)  = S / (kTR)
	- (E_b/N_o)_dB = S_dBW - 10log_10(R) + 228.6 - 10log_10(T)
	- 1 W => 10log_10(1000) = 30dBm
	- Channel Gain  P_in / P_out => 10log_10(P_in/P_out)
	- P = V^2 / R
	- P_in / P_out = (V_in^2/R)/(V_out/R) = W_in^2/W_out
	


Transmission Media

- Radio Broadcast Range = 30 MHz to 1 GHz
	- Omnidirectional Applications

- Microwave: 1GHz to 40GHz. Highly directional beams suitable for space communication

- Infrared: 3 x 10^11 to 2 x 10 ^14 Hz

- Antenna:  (See Figure 4.8 on page 128)
	- Conductor for system. Used to radiate or collect electromagnetic energy. Converted to by antenna from RF
	- Isotropic: A point in space that radiates power equally in all directions. Omnidirectional
	- Antenna Lobe: Directional Antenna patern
	
	- Antenna gain: Power output in a particular direction, compared to that produced in any direction by a perfect omnidirectional (isotropic) antenna
		- G_db = 10 log_10(P_2/P_1) where P_1 is the radiated power of the directional antenna, and P_2 is the radiated power from the reference antenna

	- Effective Area: related to the physical size of the antenna and to its shape
		- G = (4pi A_e) / (λ^2)  = (4pi f^2 A_e) / c^2
		where 
			G = antenna gain (ratio)
			A_e = effective area (m^2)
			f = carrier frequency (Hz)
			c = speed of light (3e8 m/s)
			λ = carrier wavelength (m)

	- Isotropic antenna: A_e = λ^2 / (4pi)
	
		- Ideal power gain = 7A / λ^2



Satellites
	
	- Geosynchronous satellites: Fixed at a position (~36000 km above surface) rotating with the speed of the earth
	
	- GPS
		- roughly 27 satellites provide gps
		- to gather required information, a user must be able to connect to four satellites to collect x, y, z and time.

	- Others are Orbiting satellites

	- L-Band:  1 - 2 GHz
	- S-Band:  2 - 4 GHz
	- C-Band:  4 - 8 GHz    << Most popular
	- X-Band:  8 - 12 GHz   << Mostly Military satellites
	- Ku-Band: 12 - 18 GHz
	- Ka-Band: 26 - 40 GHz


Broadcast Radio

	- Broadcast radio is omnidirectional and microwave is directional

	- Radio is the term used to encompass frequencies in the range of 3kHz to 300GHz

	- Broadcast radio (30MHz - 1 GHz) covers:
		- FM radio and UHF and VHF television band
		- Data networking applications

	- Limited to line of sight

	- Suffers from multipath interference
		- Reflections from land, water, man-made objects
	
	A table of the different bands can be found in table 4.5 on page 136

 
	- Ground wave propagation follows the contour of the earth and can propagate distances well over the visual horizon
	- This effect is found in frequencies up to about 2MHz
	- The best known example of ground wave communication is AM radio


	- Refraction - SEE PAGE 2 OF WRITTEN NOTES and page 137 of the book
	- Reflection - " " " " " " "
		- Multipath interference is produced by reflection. The same signal may travel different lengths due to reflection before
		  reaching a destination, and the receiver should be able to interpret this interference 
	- Skywave Propagation -  " " " " " " "
	-	 Ground and skywave propagation do not operate above 30MHz
	- Line of Sight Propagation - Must be visible
		- Above 30 MHz


	max distance of radio signal approx.= 3570 * sqrt(h * k)
		where h is height of antenna, k is adjustment factor for the radio horizon which is usually slightly more than the optical horizon due to bending waves


	Free space loss:
		- always present attenuation of a signal
		
		- P_t / P_r = (4pi d)^2/λ^2  = (4pi f^2 d) / c^2
		- L_db = 20 log_10(f) + 20 log_10(d) - 147.56dB

		- Friis Model ->   P_t / P_r = (4pi d)^2/(G_t * G_r * λ^2)
		- L_db = -20log_10(f) + 20 log_10(d) - 10log_10(A_t * A_r) + 169.54dB'

		- Free space loss graphed on page 141

- Analog Data, Analog Signals (see notes pg. 3)

	- There are two principal reasons for analog modulation of analog signal:
		- A higher frequency may be needed for effective transmission
		- Modulation permits frequency-division multiplexing
