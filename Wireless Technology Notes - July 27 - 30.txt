General CRC Architecture to implement Divisor
See figure 6.7 and notes page 14
Uses shift register and XOR gates

codeword
k = 2 bits
00  ->  00000
01  ->  00111
10  ->  11001
11  ->  11110

5 bits -> 32 possibilities


Coding Rate

	- k bits input -> n bits -> Coding Rate = k/n

Hamming Distance

	= The number of different bits between two values

	- d(00000, 01110) = 3

	- d_min  =     min ( d(V_i, V_j) )
			 (i =/= j) 

	- for all t,  d_min >= 2t + 1
	- up to t errors can be corrected
	- t + 1 error -> detect


How Coding Improves System Performance

	- Coding makes it require less energy to provide a decrease error rate
	- A lower E_b / N_0  (SNR) is required with coding, except at very high error rates (1 - 0.1 (this would most likely break connection anyway))
	- The difference in SNR required is the region of coding gain

Error Control Techniques (in Chapter 7)

	- Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)
		- Collective name for error control mechanisms
		- Error Detection, Positive ACK, Negative ACK
		
	- Stop and Wait ARQ
		- Source transmits single frame
		- Waits for ACK (with timeout ready)
		- If frame received is damaged, discard it
		- If ACK is damaged, transmitter will not recognize. 
			- It will resend, then receiver will discard and resend ACK
			- Every packet has a sequence number to be identifiable

		- This is a SLOW method. Not very effective


	- Go-Back-N ARQ
		- Most commonly used error control
		- Based on sliding-window
		- Use window size to control number of outstanding frames
		- While no errors occur, the destination will acknowledge incoming frames as usual
			- RR = Receive ready, or piggybacked acknowledgement
		- If the destination station detects an error in a frame, it sends a reject and discards other incoming messages
		- The lost frame and the following messages which were discarded must be retransmitted

	- Selective-Reject (ARQ)
		- Just like Go-back-N
		- The difference is that it doesn't discard others after an error, 
		  it makes the transmitter retransmit just the lost frame

Cellular Networks


Principles of Cellular Networks

	- Developed to increase the capaciy available for mobile radio telephone service
	- Prior to cellular radio:
		80km radius 25 channels

Organization
	
	- Key for mobile technologies
	- Based on the use of multiple low power transmitters
	- Area divided into cells
		- In a tiling pattern to provide full coverage
		- Each one with its own antenna
		- Each is allocated...
		- Adjacent base stations have different frequencies

Frequency Reuse

	- 10 to 50 frequencies per cell
	- Limit power to prevent it escaping to adjacent cells

	- Hexagonal pattern, no directly neighboring base stations share a frequency

		-  D = min distance of BS using the same f
		-  R = radius of hexagon
		-  d = distance btw 2 neighbor = sqrt(3)R
		-  N = reuse factor
		-  k frequencies --->  k/N freq

		-  N = I^2 + J^2 + I * J

Increasing Capacity
	
	- Add new channels
		- Not all channels used to start with

	- Frequency borrowing
		- Taken from adjacent cells by congested cells
		- Assign frequencies dynamically

	- Cell splitting  (Placing more base stations)
		- Non-uniform topography and traffic distribution
		- Use smaller cells in high use areas

	- Cell Sectoring
		- Cell is divided into wedge shaped sectors (3-6 per cell)
		- Each sector is assigned a separate subset of the cell's channels
		- Directional antennas at base station are used to focus on each sector

	- Microcells
		- As cells become smaller, antennas move from tops of hills and large buildings to tops of small buildings and sides of large buildings, to lamp posts, where they form microcells
		- Use reduced power to cover a much smaller area
		- Good for city streets in congested areas, along highways, inside large public buildings


	Ex:

	32 cells
	336 freq. ch.
	N = 7		-->   336/7 = 48
	cell r = 1.6km

	48 * 32 = 1536 callers
	D = R * sqrt(3N)



Cellular System Channels

	- Two types of channels are avail. between mobile unit and base station (BS)
	
	- Control Channels
		- Set up and maintain calls
		- Establish relationship between mobile unit and nearest base station
	- Traffic Channels
		- Carry voice and data


Mobile Radio Propagation Effects

	- Signal Strength
		- Strength of signal between BS and mobile unit needs to be strong enough maintain signal quality
		- Not too stron so as to create co-channel interference
		- Must handle variations in noise

	- Fading
		- Time variation of received signal
		- Caused by changes in transmission path(s)
		- Even if signal strength is in effective range, signal propagation effects may disrupt the signal


Design Factors

	- Propagation effects:
		- Desired maximum trasmit power level at BS
		- Multi-path propagation
			- Reflection - signal bounces off of surfaces
			- Diffraction - signal bends, goes around corners
			- Scattering - signal is scattered in many directions if it hits many objects

				-----------------------------------
							time

				Receiver has to know what it has already received



Types of Fading

	- Fast Fading
		- Rapid variations in signal strength occur over distance of about one-half a wavelength
	
	- Slow Fading
		- Change in the average received power level due to user passing different height buildings, vacant lots, intersections, etc.
	
	- Flat Fading
		- All frequency components of the received signal fluctuate in the same proportions simultaneously

	- Selective Fading
		- Attenuation occuring over a portions of the the bandwidth of the signal



Error Compensation Mechanisms
	
	Diversity
		- Based on the fact that individual channels experience independent fading events
		- Use multiple logical channels between transmitter and receiver
		- Send part of signal over each channel
		- Doesn't eliminate errors, but reduces
		- Space diversity involves physical transmission paths
		- More commonly refers to frequency or time diversity
		- Most important example of frequency diversity is spread spectrum


		- Time diversity 
			- repetition

		- Frequency diversity
			- different channels

		- Space Diversity

		- Polarization Diversity

		- Cooperative Diversity
