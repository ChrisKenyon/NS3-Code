			Wifi LAN
----------------------------------

- Multi-Cell

- Ad hoc WLAN
	- connected directly with the users around it
	- Network created by sensing all of the nearby nodes


- Access Point (AP)
- Basic Service Set (BSS)
- Coordination function
- Distribution System (DS)
- Extended service set (ESS)
- Frame
- MAC protocol data unit (MDPU)
- MAC service data unit (MSDU)
- Station

IEEE 802.11 Services

 Provided by Distribution System:
- Association
- Dissassociation
- Distribution
- Integration
- Reassociation
 Provided by Station:
- MSDU delivery
- Privacy
- Authentication
- Deauthentication


Wireless LAN Requirements

- Throughput
- Number of Nodes
- Connection to backbone LAN
- Service area
- Battery power consumption
- Transmission robustness and security
- Collocated network operation
- License-free operation
- Handoff/roaming
- Dynamic configuration



Wi-Fi Alliance

- There is always a concern whether products from different vendors will
  successfully interoperate
- Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA)
	- Industry consortium formed in 1999


Association-Related Services
	
- DS requires information about stations within the ESS that is provided 
  by the association-related services
- Station must be associated before DS can deliver data to or accept data from it
- 3 mobility transition types:
	- No transition
		- stationary or in single BSS
	- BSS transition
		- between BSS in same ESS
	- ESS transition
		- between different BSS in different ESS

- DS needs to know the identity of the AP to which the message should be delivered
	- Station must maintain association with AP within current BSS

- Association - establishes initial association between station and AP
- Reassociation - enables an established association to be transferred from one
  AP to another
- Disassociation - a notification from either a station or an AP that an
  existing association is terminated



Reliable Data Delivery

- Can be dealt with at a higher layer
- More efficient to deal with errors at MAC level



Random Channel Access

- ALOHA protocol simply says when you receive a packet to transmit, send it
- A collision happens when two packets are scheduled to send at the same time

	Δ	----->	Δ	<------ Δ
	1 			2 			3

	S_1 = S_3	

	S_1 / (N + S_3) ≈ 1
	S_3 / (N + S_1) ≈ 1

- CSMA - Carrier Sensing Multiple Access
	- Listen-Before-Talk
- CSMA/CD
	- Has Collision Detection
- CSMA/CA
	- Has collision avoidance

- We don't use Collision Detection in wireless because transmission signals can
  mask receiving signals

 - Binary Exponential Function - increase the wait time for each failure to access the channel
   if random time access is not working


Four Frame Exchange

 - Hidden Terminal Problem

 x ----------------> terminal  <------------------- y
 			[>>>>>>pkt>>>>>>]
 						[<<<<<<pkt<<<<<]
 						 Δ
 						 |
 						 collision

 	- x and y are at the far ends of the access point - largely increases chance of collision

 - This problem is fixed by RTS and CTS, which are used in densely used networks

 x ----------------> terminal  <------------------- y
 									[<<RTS<<]
		[>>CTS>>]
 									[<<DATA<<]
		[>>ACK>>]		 
 						 


- RTS alerts all stations within range of source that exchange is under way
- CTS alerts all stations within range of destination
- Other stations don't trasnmit to avoid collision
- RTS/CTS exchange is a required function of MAC but may be disabled
- Can use four-frame exchange for better reliability
	- Source issues a Request To Send (RTS) frame
	- Destination responds with Clear To Send (CTS)
	- After receiving CTS, source transmits data
	- Destination responds with ACK 


  
See Figures on pg. 405-407

Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)

- DCF sublayer uses CSMA algorithm
- Does not include a collision dtection function because it is not practical
